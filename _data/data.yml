    title: Career Profile
    summary: | 
      Since leaving education I have continued to be fascinated by technology 
      and programming. This passion has lead me to pursue some interesting projects (which
      I hope to showcase below) and work with many great people. As I continue to grow as
      an engineer I am always looking for areas to expand my knowledge. Currently I 
      am really enjoying programming within Golang as I believe it is a very flexible 
      language that can very easily translate into business needs quickly. You can go 
      from needing a new webserver to having one up and running within a few minutes. My main
      ambition is to trainsition into a software engineer role and begin to lead these projects from the 
      begining to the end.
